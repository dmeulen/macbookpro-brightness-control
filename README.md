# macbookpro-brightness-control
Macbook Pro 11.x Screen and Keyboard brightness control for use with i3wm or any other wm.

Still very rudimentary, but works...

Start mbc as root with `mbc start` or install the `mbc.service` systemd unit...

Use `mbc -h` for options and bind your keys in your i3 config.
